Version 0.9.1.1
  Changed features
    - Openbook Cleaner now runs under Java 6, Java 7 is no longer required
  Internal changes
    - Switch zip file handling to Apache Commons Compress 1.4.1. Thanks to user
      Christian Feneberg for pointing out that Java 7 on MacOS ist still in preview
      stage and thus not preinstalled on most Macs.


Version 0.9.1
  New features
    - CLI (command line interface)
        * Accept multiple book IDs or '-a' (all books) on command line. This makes
          convenience class AllOpenbooksCleaner with its own main method obsolete.
        * New option '-n' skips final pretty-printing after clean up. This optionally saves
          around 15% processing time, but the final result will not be pretty-printed by
          JTidy, it remains as written by XOM (which produces correct, but not nicely
          formatted XHTML).
  Changed features
    - Java 7 is now required because of the vcsharp_2008 unpacking bugfix (see below)
  Bugfixes
    - Book vcsharp_2008 could not be unpacked because it contains two files with special
      characters (German umlauts). This was due to a character encoding of "Cp437" while
      Java always expects UTF-8. Thanks to user Dirk Höpfner for notifying me about the bug.
  Internal changes
    - Option parsing: simplify loop and make it more readable
    - Option parsing: add log output for book_id arguments
    - Create separate methods for single- and multi-threaded conversion
    - ZipInputStream now explicitly uses "Cp437" encoding, a new feature available only
      in Java 7 after years of waiting.
    - BasicFilter: turn member debugLogMessage into method getDebugLogMessage. This
      removes the constructor parameter debugLogMessage from BasicFilter, making the
      constructor signature consistent with that of its subclasses. Also update all
      concrete subclasses so as to implement the abstract method and to use the changed
      constructor.
    - File extensions moved from application class OpenbookCleaner to static member
      FILE_EXTENSION in all concrete BasicFilter subclasses.
    - Rename SINGLE_THREADED_WITH_INTERMEDIATE_FILES to MULTI_THREADED. This also means
      that the logic is reversed now, but still multi-threaded mode is the default, so
      there is no change in behaviour.
    - Encapsulate filtering & threading in new class FilterChain. The new class iterates
      over a Queue of class objects (not instances!) and dynamically sets up the
      conversion/filtering chain, instantiating concrete BasicFilter subclass objects via
      reflection. This works in single- as well as multi-threaded mode, as usual using
      intermediate files for the former and piped streams for the latter. This makes class
      OpenbookCleaner cleaner, not violating the single purpose principle anymore. Only a
      nicely readable version of method 'convert' remains, methods 'convertSingleThreaded'
      and 'convertMultiThreaded' are gone. Furthermore, 'convert' now takes File arguments
      and no longer File*Stream ones, because FilterChain creates its own streams.


Version 0.9
  New features
    - Download, MD5-check and unpack books automatically before filtering
    - Download hi-res book cover image for each book (can be used as covers for e-books)
    - Page titles are filtered so as to remove book names and get clean chapter numbers and names.
      E.g. something like "Galileo Computing :: Book title - 1.2.3 Chapter title" becomes
      "1.2.3 Chapter title". Special fixes are applied to TOC (index.htm*) pages.
    - AllOpenbooksCleaner knows new books visualbasic_2008, einstieg_vb_2010
    - CLI (command line interface)
        * Former book path (subdirectory) is now a book ID
        * New mandatory parameter download directory (also base directory for book subdirectories)
          is needed because of the new download feature and must be inserted as the first
          non-option parameter before the book ID. 
  Changed features
    - Books are now unpacked into subdirectories with predefined names which might be different
      from the download archive names. E.g. archive galileocomputing_shell_programmierung.zip
      will be unpacked to folder shell_prog.
  Internal changes
    - Refactor pre-JTidy HTML fixing into its own BasicConverter subclass PreJTidyFilter
      and move some code there. Currently this filter class only fixes the "Ruby on Rails 2"
      book because other books doe not need to be pre-filtered just to readable by JTidy.
    - Reorganise package structure and rename some filter (converter) classes & methods
    - New class (enum) BookInfo to be used by the download/unpack features
    - New utility classes FileDownloader (incl. MD5 check), ZipFileExtractor
    - New class Downloader can download & unpack openbooks


Version 0.8
  - Initial release
  - Can convert 30 known openbooks, but has not download/unpack functionality yet
  - Developed in Java7
  - Needs libraries
      * JTidy r938
      * XOM 1.2.8
      * TagSoup 1.2.1
