HTML cleaner for Galileo openbooks
==================================

This is a tool for cleaning up [Galileo Computing openbooks](http://www.galileocomputing.de/openbook) before converting them to EPUB or PDF format. It is meant to be an improved reimplementation of my [bash shell script using xml2](https://github.com/kriegaex/html_book_cleaner). In opposite to the script which is just meant to be a proof of concept for two books, this tool is meant to convert *__all__* books.

__Current state of development:__ The tool can convert all openbooks, but in opposite to the shell script version it does not download and unpack them automatically beforehand.

__Dependencies:__ The tool was developed in Java 7, but might work in older JREs too (untested). It also uses a few open source libraries:
* [JTidy r938](http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/) for converting the original Galileo files from unclean HTML into XHTML and also for pretty-printing the final result (XOM does not pretty-print). *__Please note__* that *JTidy* itself needs two patches I created because otherwise it cannot handle all of Galileo's faulty HTML. The patches are part of this repository, so you need to download *JTidy* from source ([jtidy-r938-sources.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy/files/JTidy/r938/jtidy-r938-sources.zip/download)), patch and build it by yourself. This is simple enough, but you need to do it. You can also find the patches in the following *JTidy* bug tickets:
  * [BR within PRE rendered with additional linefeeds - ID: 3532720](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3532720&group_id=13153&atid=113153)
  * [Non-breaking space in HEAD rejected - ID: 3532726](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3532726&group_id=13153&atid=113153)
* [XOM 1.2.8](http://www.xom.nu/) is an XML library used for parsing the XHTML output of *JTidy* into a DOM representation which can then be manipulated via XPath queries. The main part of the clean-up work is done using *XOM*. Direct JAR download: [xom-1.2.8.jar](http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/xom-1.2.8.jar)
* [TagSoup 1.2.1](http://ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/) is a SAX-compliant HTML parser which nicely integrates into *XOM*. Initially I had planned to use it directly for parsing the original HTML files, but it could not handle them well, so I added *JTidy* to the mix. Unfortunately *JTidy* has no direct *XOM* integration because it is not SAX-compliant, so it cannot replace *TagSoup*. This is how I ended up using both libraries. Maybe I will find a way to remove one of them in the future.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
__To do:__
* I want to add the missing download and unpack steps, so the tool can be used stand-alone and fully replace the old shell script.
* I dislike the current code structure and want to do some refactoring. Because I have not programmed in a long time (I used to be a full-time developer in the 1990s and am a project management coach now), development is not my daily work anymore, so even though I already refactored a lot of things before the initial upload, there is still a lot to be done to satisfy my own demands from a design and [software craftsmanship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) perspective. See also the book [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert C. Martin.
* There are a few know bugs, mostly minor annoyances concerning parsing and cleaning up structural specialties in some openbooks. Even though the tool already handles a lot of specialties, there still are a few left at the time of writing this (2012-06-12).
* I am not sure about it, but I might start writing *unit tests* for the tool if I ever feel like it. Practicing a bit of TDD is something I have not done in a long time, except for recommending and introducing it to my clients as an agile coach. I would not consider myself a professional developer without practicing TDD, but after all I am no longer a professional developer. ;-)

Because of the missing features and open bugs as well as the *clean code* and *refactoring* stuff mentioned above and because I want to learn about the *Git* integration in *Eclipse* (I currently only know a bit of *Git* command-line stuff), I guess it will be nice to do this step by step, documenting my progress in small, fine-granular *Git* changesets, so later on I can review my own progress.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As you can see, I am mostly doing this little project for myself, but I like to share the results and receive some user feedback. I hope the openbook cleaner is useful to you. Enjoy! :-)
